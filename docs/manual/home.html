<B>Jini Examples</B>
<BR><BR>

The Jini technology is brilliant, but the lack of examples, easy to
understand, is the real problem for the beginners. I went through it
and have some number of easy tests and examples that could help developers
in this new for them area.
<BR><BR>

Before the start, the developer should download 
<A HREF ="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jiniexamples/JiniExamples-2.1.001.src.zip">sources</A> for the tests.
To get started you will compile everything with the help of
<A target="none" HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</A>
tool.
To download required libraries you have to use
<A target="none" HREF="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</A> tool. Internally, Ant uses Maven2 to download dependencies.
In order to do this, your Ant tool should use Maven Tasks for Ant library:
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">maven-artifact-ant-2.0.4-dep.jar</a>. You need to copy this file into
<b>${ant.home}/lib</b> directory.
<BR><BR>

Unzip downloaded archive and make changes in <B>project.properties</B> 
file. You have to specify <B>jini.home</B> property. It will be used by Ant 
tool to find out required libraries and security policies.
<BR><BR>

All examples are built on the base of the little library (<b>org.sf.jini.examples.common</b> package)
with the following classes:
<BR><BR>
- <B>JiniService</B> - common class for any Jini service in these examples;
<BR>
- <B>ProxiedJiniService</B> - derived from <B>JiniService</B> class that represents proxied service;
<BR>
- <B>ActivatableService</B> - derived from <B>ProxiedJiniService</B> class that represents activatable service;
<BR>
- <B>ActivatableFactory</B> - the class that simplifies creation of activatable objects;
<BR>
- <B>JiniClient</B> - common class for any Jini client;
<BR>
- <B>ListenerClient</B> - Jini client that supports listening of events, extends <B>JiniClient</B> class functionality;
<BR>
- <B>Util</B> - class with convenient common methods for Jini lookup.
<BR><BR>

For building jar files for Jini services and client,
<a href="https://classdepandjar.dev.java.net/">classdepandjar ant task</a> is used. You don't have to download it though -
Maven will do this work for you. 
<BR><BR>
Now you could start. All examples represent minimalistic approach
for coding complexity and number of explanations. Just go through sources.
You are smart enough to understand them. Currently, I have the following groups of examples:

<BR><BR>
<LI><A HREF="simpletests/index.html">Simple tests</A>;</LI>
<LI><A HREF="advancedtests/index.html">Advanced tests</A>;</LI>
<LI><A HREF="practicalexamples/index.html">Practical examples</A>;</LI>
<BR><BR>

If these examples will help you to start with Jini, I'll be happy. Don't
hesitate to get me your
