<B>Activatable Jeri service</B>
<BR><BR>

Now we 'll try to convert <B>remote</B> service into <B>Activatable</B> object.
In this case the service shouldn't occupy memory all the time. Instead,
we'll register our services on <B>phoenix</B> as the code that will be 
activated only on client's request. All the rest time our service will be 
kept in serialized form.
<BR><BR>

This example is based on <B>remote</B> primer. We will modify remote filter's 
implementation (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.activation.ActFilterImpl</B>) by exporting our
object through activation system. The service
(<B>org.sf.jini.examples.activation.ActFilterService</B>) performs all preparation work
for creating activatable object. And the client part 
(<B>org.sf.jini.examples.activation.ActFilterClient</B>) is just looking for 
required service.
<BR><BR>

After the build we have 3 archives: 
<LI>for service itself (<B>lib-service/act-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>docroot/service/act-filter-service-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for activation framework 
(<B>docroot/service/act-filter-service-act.jar</B>).</LI>
<BR><BR>

The last archive is required for activation framework, because it knows
nothing about activatable objects a priori and publishing the code on the web
is the only way to resolve the problem.
<BR><BR>

Now it's time to test them. Execute these commands in the following order:

<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant phoenix.start</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant act.service</B>
<BR><BR>

Usually it takes some time to register the service. Wait...
<BR><BR>

Now, you can strat the client:
<BR><BR>

<B>>ant act.client</B>
<BR><BR>

This service is registering for 3 minutes. After that the lease will be 
expired and service terminated automatically.
<BR><BR>

The <B>org.sf.jini.examples.activation.Updater</B> class is designed as primitive form of lease
renewal service. It is implemented as separate thread that updates lease
iteratively. When the service starts, it saves the registration object as 
marshalled object inside the file. The <B>org.sf.jini.examples.acrivation.Updater</B> class
reads this file, reconstitutes the marshalled object and starts threading.
<BR><BR>

To test this class, start the command:

<BR><BR>
<B>>ant act.updater</B>
<BR><BR>

You got correct answer? Move ahead.
