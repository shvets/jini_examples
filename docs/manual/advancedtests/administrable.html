<B>Administrable service</B>
<BR><BR>


Let's try to create the service that supports remote adminstration.
<BR><BR>

This example is based on <B>remoteservice</B> primer. We will modify remote filter 
(<B>org.sf.jini.examples.adm.AdmFilter</B>) and it's implementation (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.adm.AdmFilterImpl</B>).
The last class is implemented as <b>administrable</b> object. To support proxy object we use
<b>org.sf.jini.examples.common.ProxiedJiniService</b> class.
<BR><BR>

The service (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.adm.AdmFilterService</B>) registers corresponding proxy object,
whereas the client (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.adm.AdmFilterClient</B>) is looking for required 
service.
<BR><BR>

After the build we have 3 archives: 
<LI>for service itself (<B>target/lib/adm-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>target/docroot/service/adm-filter-service-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for activation framework 
(<B>target/docroot/service/adm-filter-service-act.jar</B>).</LI>
<BR><BR>

Now it's time to test them. Execute these commands in the following order:

<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant phoenix.start</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant adm.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant adm.client</B>
<BR><BR>

The client will check the interfaces, implemented by proxy object and if
it implements <B>Administrable</B> interface, the client will try to remove 
the service.
<BR><BR>

To check all these events in dynamic manner, look at jini browser window.
You will see how service is added to registrar and how it will be deleted.
Don't forget to select the registrar from the <B>Regisrar</B> menu item.
<BR><BR>

Afrer completing the tes, don't forget to shutdown Phoenix service:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant phoenix.stop</B>
<BR>
