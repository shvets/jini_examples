<B>Administrable and Activatable Service</B>
<BR><BR>


Let's try to create the service that is activatable and supports remote adminstration.
<BR><BR>

This example is based on <B>remote</B> primer. We will modify remote filter implementation as administrable
(<B>org.sf.jini.examples.adm.AdmFilterImpl</B>) with activatable support (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.admact.AdmActFilterImpl</B>).
The last class is implemented as activatable object.
<BR><BR>

The service (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.admact.AdmFilterService</B>) registers corresponding proxy object,
whereas the client (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.adm.AdmFilterClient</B>) is looking for required 
service.
<BR><BR>

After the buildt we have 3 archives: 
<LI>for service itself (<B>target/lib/adm-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>target/docroot/service/adm-filter-service-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for activation framework 
(<B>target/docroot/service/adm-filter-service-act.jar</B>).</LI>
<BR><BR>

Now it's time to test them. Execute these commands in the following order:

<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant phoenix.start</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant admact.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant admact.client</B>
<BR><BR>

The client will check the interfaces, implemented by proxy object and if
it implements <B>Administrable</B> interface, the client will try to remove 
the service.
<BR><BR>

To check all these events in dynamic manner, look at jini browser window.
You will see how service is added to registrar and how it will be deleted.
Don't forget to select the registrar from the <B>Regisrar</B> menu item.
<BR><BR>

In this example the service also uses more sofisticated way to inform the
client part about it's details on the bas of the <B>ServiceInfo</B> class 
instead of the <B>Name</B>.
