<B>Fiddler example</B>
<BR><BR>

The <B>Fiddler</B> is Sun's implementation of <B>LookupDiscoveryService</B> 
interface. This implementation could be used as convenient way for 
starting services dynamically when new registrars created.
<BR><BR>

The service (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.fiddler.FiddlerService</B>) looks for
the <B>LeaseRenewalService</B> and <B>LookupDiscoveryService</B> services. 
If they started, the program gets the <B>LeaseRenewalSet</B> object. 
The last will be used for registering services that requires lease renewal.
<BR><BR>

On the next step we creates two activatable objects: the listener of lease 
renewal events (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.fiddler.LeaseRenewer</B>) and the listener of 
lookup discoveries (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.fiddler.DiscoveryListener</B>).The first object
is registering on <B>LeaseRenewalSet</B> as the listener of expiration
warnings and lease failures. It will be activated by activation system few 
seconds before some lease expired. It's main goal is to renew leases for 
all registered services. After finishing its work this listener will go 
to inactive state.
<BR><BR>

The second object (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.fiddler.DiscoveryListener</B>) will listen for lookup
services discoveries and when it will happen, starts out our service.
<BR><BR>

We don't register our service in the main program, as we did it in <B>norm</B>
example. Instead, we create marshalled object that holds our service 
(or some its part), lease renewal set and some additional parameters. 
We transfer this data holder to discovery listener when it is created.
The discovery listener could extract required information and perform 
registration, when new registrar will be discovered.
<BR><BR>

The client  (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.fiddler.FiddlerClient</B>) has no additional functionality. 
It only looks for required service.
<BR><BR>

After the build we have 4 archives: 
<LI>for service itself (<B>lib-service/fiddler-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>docroot/service/fiddler-filter-service-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for lease renewer as activatable object
(<B>docroot/client/fiddler-filter-service-act.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for lookup discovery listener as activatable object
(<B>docroot/client/fiddler-filter-service-act2.jar</B>).</LI>
<BR><BR>

Now it's time to test them. Run these commands:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant fiddler.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant fiddler.client</B>
<BR><BR>

If you need to remove <B>fiddler</B> service form the registrar, start 
the command:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant fiddler.destroy</B>
<BR><BR>

You could do the same from the space borowser. To do it select the service 
from the list, activate context menu and choose <B>Admin Service</B>. 
New Window will be displayed. Choose <B>Admin|Destroy</B> item from the menu.
