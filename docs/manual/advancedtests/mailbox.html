<B>EventMailbox example</B>
<BR><BR>

The <b>EventMailbox</b> is the Jini service that could listen for events on behalf
of some client. Client could read them later in one shot. If this 
behavior is appropriate for the application, this example will be useful
for understanding how to do it.
<BR><BR>

The <B>mercury</B> is Sun's implementation of the event mailbox service.
<BR><BR>

This example is built on the base of <B>eventgen</B> primer. We'll slightly
modify those clients. 
<BR><BR>

The first client (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.mailbox.MailboxClient1</B>), which 
previously was listening the events (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.eventgen.ExtFilterClient1</B>),
now reassigned this task to the EventMailbox service. So it's not required 
to publish its code on the web.
<BR><BR>

The second client (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.mailbox.MailboxClient2</B>) performs the similar 
task like <B>org.sf.jini.examples.eventgen.ExtFilterClient2</B>, making modifications on service
side.
<BR><BR>

And finally, we have the <B>org.sf.jini.examples.mailbox.MailboxReader</B> class, that 
performs reading events from the EventMailbox. To do that, it should publish 
corresponding code on the Web.
<BR><BR>

The <B>org.sf.jini.examples.mailbox.MailboxClient1</B> and <B>org.sf.jini.examples.mailbox.MailboxReader</B> classes
share the same instance of the event mailbox registration. To do that 
the client saves the registration as marshalled object in serialized 
stream as <B>"mymailbox.mb"</B> file. Later, when reader is trying to 
read events, it reconstitutes serialized marshalled object and performs
reading.
<BR><BR>

After the build we have 4 archives. The only 3 of them are required 
for this task: 
<LI>for service itself (<B>lib-service/eg-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>docroot/service/eg-filter-service-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for server that will notify the client about incoming events
(<B>docroot/client/mb-filter-client-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<BR><BR>

Now it's time to test them. Run this command first:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR><BR>

Start the service and publish it:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant egen.service</B>
<BR><BR>

Now let's start the first client that will register the EventMailbox service
as events listener:

<BR><BR>
<B>>ant mbox.client1</B>
<BR><BR>

Start the second client:

<BR><BR>
<B>>ant mbox.client2</B>
<BR><BR>

It will make some modification, that will be saved in EventMailbox as events
for the delivery.
<BR><BR>

You could start second client multiple number of times. It will add new
events to EventMailbox.
<BR><BR>

Finally, try to read events from the EventMailbox:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant mbox.reader</B>
<BR><BR>

This command will display all events, collected already in the event mailbox 
and will remove all the messages from it.
