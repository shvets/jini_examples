<B>JavaSpace test</B>
<BR><BR>

In this example we make simple experiments with JavaSpace. Don't be
afraid - it's just yet another Jini service (<B>outrigger</B>). 
Additional service that is required - the Transaction Manager 
(<B>mahalo</B>). Before example could be tested, the Transaction Manager 
should be registered and JavaSpace should be started. But don't worry, these services
are already included:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR><BR>

Dependent services list:
<b>
<BR>
- reggie;
<BR> 
- outrigger;
<BR> 
- mahalo;
<BR> 
- http server for Jini libraries;
<BR> 
- http server for this service;
</b>
<BR><BR> 

The JavaSpace is the environment that could keep shared instances of
the <B>net.jini.core.entry.Entry</B> type. We have one such representative:
<B>org.sf.jini.examples.javaspace.Message</B>. The <B>org.sf.jini.examples.javaspace.JavaSpaceTest</B> class
is the client, that looks for two services - JavaSpace and Transaction 
Manager. If these services are discovered, the client will try to create 
messages and write them ino JavaSpace without and with transaction support.
The rest of the code will try to read/print/take these entries from the
JavaSpace.
<BR><BR>

Now, compile example and test it:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant javaspace.test</B>
<BR><BR>

You also could run another "hello-world-from-jini" example borrowed from <b>blitz</b> project. 
It's not dependent on "blitz" project though. In order to run this example, execute these commands:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant blitzhelloworld.taker</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant blitzhelloworld.writer</B>
<BR><BR>
