<B>Client listening for events</B>
<BR><BR>

In this example we will create a client, registered for listening event from
<B>reggie</B> service. 
<BR><BR>

We have two additional classes here - for client 
(<B>org.sf.jini.examples.eclient.EventFilterClient</B>) and for service
(<B>org.sf.jini.examples.eclient.EventFilterService</B>).
<BR><BR>

After the build we have 2 archives: 
<LI>for service itself (<B>lib-service/ec-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>docroot/service/ec-filter-service-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<BR>

Now it's time to test them. Start this command:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR><BR>

For this example we have to take care of these services:
<BR> 
- reggie;
<BR> 
- http server for Jini libraries;
<BR> 
- http server for this service;
<BR> 
- http server for client code;
<BR><BR> 

Try to start the client:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant eclient.client</B>
<BR><BR>

You could see that the service could not be found. In this case the client 
will go to the waiting mode.
<BR><BR>

Now register the service:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant eclient.service</B>
<BR><BR>

After service registration look at client's console. Finally it got the event.
