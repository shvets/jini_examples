<B>Federate example</B>
<BR><BR>

This example is based on similar example from <a href="http://www.incax.com/examples.htm">IncaX</a> company.
<BR><BR>

Federated example shows how to connect (federate) lookup services. Why do we need this?
By federating these services we provide the following functionality to the client.
The client needs to be registered only on one lookup service. All the services from another lookup service are
automatically available to the client thanks to the federation.
<BR><BR>

This doesn't work out-of-the box though. You need to write the discovery code, which can "tunnel" from one federated
lookup service to another. This is done by implementing special lookup method for the client in supporting class:
<b>org.sf.jini.examples.common.FederatedServiceLocator</b> that implements
<b>net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryListener</b>.
<BR><BR>

You need to run the following commands:
<BR><BR>
<b>
>start ant federate.services
<BR>
>ant federate.federate
<BR>
>ant federate.service
<BR>
>ant federate.client
<BR><BR>
</b>

First, you run standard Jini services. The only difference here is that  you run 2 lookup services (reggie)
instead of one. We use <b>src/main/config/reggie1.config</b> and <b>src/main/config/reggie2.config</b>
configuration files to run them.
<BR><BR>

Second command federates 2 lookup services together. After that we register the service on both lookup services.
<BR><BR>
And finally we run client, that locates all services on both lookup services and executes discovered services
consequently.
