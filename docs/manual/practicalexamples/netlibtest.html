<B>Test with NetLib library</B>
<BR><BR>

In this example we'll make experiments with 
<A HREF="http://home.comcast.net/~shvets/Downloads/netlib.zip">NetLib library</A>. You should download
the most resent version or use one that resides in the <B>lib</B> directory.
<BR><BR>

We have the following classes here:
<BR><BR>
- <B>org.sf.jini.examples.netlib.NetlibClient</B> - the test client;
<BR>
- <B>org.sf.jini.examples.netlib.NetlibService</B> - the test service;
<BR>
- <B>org.sf.jini.examples.netlib.JiniServer</B> - the class that represents Jini service as a server;
<BR>
- <B>org.sf.jini.examples.netlib.NetlibServer</B> - the test server, extension of 
<B>org.sf.jini.examples.netlib.JiniServer</B> class.
<BR><BR>

Client listens for events. If the server is not started yet, the client 
will wait. After receiving the notification from the server, the client 
creates simple request and send it to the server. Server prepares responses 
and sends them to the client. Server class is just wrapper around service, so 
when we start the server, we register the service and when we stop the server,
we terminate the service by cancelling the lease.
<BR><BR>

After the build we have 3 archives: 
<LI>for the service itself (<B>lib-service/netlib-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for the client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>docroot/service/netlib-service-dl.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for the server that will notify the client about incoming events
(<B>docroot/client/netlib-client-dl.jar</B>).</LI>

<BR><BR>
Ready? Execute these commands in the following order:

<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant netlib.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant netlib.client</B>
<BR><BR>
Well done.
