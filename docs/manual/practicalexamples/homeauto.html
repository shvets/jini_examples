<BR><BR>

In this example we'll make more experiments with
<A HREF="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS library</A>. The original source for this examples
is located <a href="https://home-automation.dev.java.net/">here</a>. 
<BR><BR>

Below we have 3 examples:
<b>
<li>music service</li>
<li>time service</li>
<li>speech service</li>
</b>
<BR><BR>

For all these examples we have the client (remote control). It is built with the help of ServiceUI library.
It waits for services to be registered and when any service get registered, it adds this service to
the client pane.
<BR><BR>

The music service is mp3 player.
<BR><BR>

The time service can speak current server side time. It also uses better tuned voice
(only numbers and only in English language).
<BR><BR>

The speech service can speak the entered text.
<BR><BR>

First, you have to start standard Jini services and the client:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant homeauto.client</B>
<BR><BR>

Now you can test examples.
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant homeauto.music.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant homeauto.time.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant homeauto.speech.service</B>
<BR><BR>

After starting each service one more pane should be created on client side. By selecting one
of the pane you can work with different services.
For music service select the mp3 file and click "Play" button.
For time service select the mp3 file and click "Play" button.
