<B>Simple Remote Service over JERI started from configuration file</B>
<BR><BR>

We'll develop a very simple service, based on the previous example. It is exactly the same
(<B>org.sf.jini.examples.remote.RemoteFilter, org.sf.jini.examples.remote.RemoteFilterImpl</B>), 
except the service class. It should be aware of Jini lifecycle. It means that constructor
method should be implemented in the following way:
<BR>

<PRE>
  public RemoteConfService(String args[], LifeCycle aLifecycle) throws Exception {
    // move code from main method here
  }
</PRE>

This example depends on the following services:
<BR>
- reggie;
<BR>
- http server for Jini libraries;
<BR>
- http server for this service;
<BR><BR>

For this example these jar files will be created:
<BR>
<LI>for service itself (<B>target/lib/remoteconf-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service
(<B>target/docroot/service/remoteconf-filter-service-dl.jar</B>).</LI>
<BR><BR>

The service uses configuration file, located in <B>src\main\config\remoteconf.config</B>. Here
where we define our transport protocol details.
<BR><BR>
For starting this service, another configuration file is used: <B>src\main\config\start-remoteconf.config</B>).
<BR><BR>

Run this commands:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR>
<B>>start ant remoteconf.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant remoteconf.client</B>
<BR><BR>

If you have some time before running the client, probably your new service has been expired. Restart
your service and then run your client again.
