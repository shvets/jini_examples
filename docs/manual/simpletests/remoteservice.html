<B>Simple Remote Service over JERI</B>
<BR><BR>

This example tries to solve the same task as previous example (Simple Service). The only one difference is that
in previous example we call service methods directly, but here we'll do it through the proxy object. The proxy object
will be generated with the help of JERI transport protocol.
<BR><BR>

In previous example the filter implementation (<B>simpleservice.FilterImpl</B>)
was registered as a proxy for the Jini service. This means that there was 
no communication protocol. All work was performed on the client side. 
<BR><BR>

For this task we'll create service interface (<B>RemoteFilter</B>) for 
remote communications and its implementation (<B>RemoteFilterImpl</B>). 
The only reason to do it is because service interface should extend 
<B>java.rmi.Remote</B> interface and all methods should have <B>throws</B>
clause <B>java.rmi.RemoteException</B>.
<BR><BR>

With JERI, we don't have to create proxy class for wrapping remote implementation, like for previous
versions of Jini. Instead, we export our implementation, e.g.:

<PRE>
    proxy = exporter.export(remote);
</PRE>

It is the responsibility of the service to do this work. The client (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.remote.RemoteFilterClient</B>)
looks for this service proxy object.
<BR><BR>

This example depends on the following services:
<BR>
- reggie;
<BR>
- http server for Jini libraries;
<BR>
- http server for this service;
<BR><BR>

Before running client or service, these archives will be created:
<LI>for service itself (<B>lib-service/remote-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>docroot/service/remote-filter-service-dl.jar</B>).</LI>
<BR><BR>

Run standard command:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR><BR>

Now it's time to test the example. Execute these commands in the following order:

<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant remote.service</B>
<BR>
<B>>ant remote.client</B>
<BR><BR>

For demonstration purposes the code for this service uses lease renewal 
manager. The manager will support this service for 60 seconds.
<BR><BR>

You got it? Let's go to the next example.
