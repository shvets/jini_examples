<B>Developing Simple Service</B>
<BR><BR>

Jini development requires a big amount of preparation work. This example, 
like all other examples uses separate ant build file (<B>ant/build-simpleservice.xml</B>). There is
also a main <B>build.xml</B> file, that calls corresponding commands from
child build file.
<BR><BR>

We'll develop a very simple service (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.simpleservice.Filter</B>) that takes
some string as a parameter, performs some modifications (filtering) and
returns modified string. The implementation (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.simpleservice.FilterImpl</B>)
just mirrors input string:
<PRE>
public class FilterImpl implements Serializable, Filter {

  public FilterImpl() {}

  public String filter(String message) {
    return message;
  }

}
</PRE>

For this interface we have a service (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.simpleservice.FilterService</B>) and 
a client (<B>org.sf.jini.examples.simpleservice.FilterClient</B>).
<BR><BR>

This example depends on the following services:
<BR> 
- reggie;
<BR> 
- http server for Jini libraries;
<BR> 
- http server for this service;
<BR><BR> 

You can run all these services (and some more: fiddler,  mahalo,  mercury, norm,  outrigger,
http server for client, if necessary) by using the following command:
<BR><BR>
<B>>start ant start.services</B>
<BR><BR>

You can check complete configuration for this command here:
<B>src\main\config\start-all.config</B>.
<BR><BR>

By running server or client, ant script creates all required libraries and place them in correct folders.
Library for the server goes to <B>target/lib</B> folder, for client to access this service - to
<B>target/docroot/service</B>, for client who is interested in listening some events -
to <B>target/docroot/client</B> folder. You don't have to call jar generation command directly. Otherwise,
run this command:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant sservice.jar</B>
<BR><BR>

For this example 2 archives will be generated: 
<LI>for service itself (<B>target/lib/ss-filter-service.jar</B>);</LI>
<LI>for client that wants to work with this service 
(<B>target/docroot/service/ss-filter-service-dl.jar</B>).</LI>

<BR><BR>
Start the client before the service registration. It will try to find the service:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant sservice.client</B>
<BR><BR>

Since the service is not registered yet, client will get the response:
<B>"Filter service did not found"</B>.
<BR><BR>

Now let's register the service:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant sservice.service</B>
<BR><BR>

The service is registered now - for 1 minute (leasing time). After that the service should
be registered again.
<BR><BR>

Now start the client again:
<BR><BR>
<B>>ant sservice.client</B>
<BR><BR>

The client will retrieve required *-dl.jar from running http server for this service. This http server
is automatically started when you start all the services. The server picks archive 
in <B>docroot/service/ss-filter-service-dl.jar</B>
and transmits it automatically on client's request.
